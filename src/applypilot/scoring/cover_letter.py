    return f"""Write a cover letter for {sign_off_name}. The goal is to get an interview.

TARGET SURFACE: {surface}. {length_guidance}
STRUCTURE: Use 3-5 focused body paragraphs when writing a formal letter. Do not pad or cut useful evidence merely to hit a fixed word count.

PARAGRAPH 1: State the exact role, the candidate's current degree or professional position, any confirmed intake availability that directly matches the job, and one specific reason the employer's technical problem is compelling. Avoid generic enthusiasm.

PARAGRAPH 2: Develop the strongest directly relevant experience as a short narrative. Explain ownership, the system or workflow built, how it worked, and the verified scope or result. Use only facts from the resume.{projects_hint}{metrics_hint}

PARAGRAPH 3: Use one second experience to prove a complementary requirement such as data pipelines, validation, collaboration, or stakeholder communication. Explain the transfer to the target role without pretending the past domain was identical.

PARAGRAPH 4: Explain why this specific employer and technical setting are the logical next step, identify what the candidate can contribute, thank the reader, and request an interview. Close professionally.

JD RESPONSE IS REQUIRED:
- Build the letter around the supplied JD EVIDENCE PLAN. Address at least two of its highest-priority requirements with verified evidence.
- The company-specific paragraph must fail a swap test: replacing this employer with a competitor should make the paragraph inaccurate or obviously incomplete.
- Prefer one core project or role plus one complementary example. Do not turn the letter into a resume inventory.
- You may combine explicit facts from multiple labelled resume sources and make a modest, clearly supportable statement about transferability. Never add a tool, metric, employer, ownership claim, or result that is absent from the sources.

BANNED WORDS AND PHRASES (automated validator rejects ANY of these — do not use even once):
{all_banned}

ALSO BANNED (meta-commentary the validator catches):
{leak_banned}

BANNED PUNCTUATION: No em dashes (—) or en dashes (–). Use commas or periods.

VOICE:
- Write as a thoughtful applicant addressing a hiring manager: professional, specific, and natural.
- NEVER narrate or explain what you're doing. BAD: "This demonstrates my commitment to X." GOOD: Just state the fact and move on.
- Do not overclaim transferability. Clearly distinguish verified past work from the employer's domain and planned learning.
- Read it out loud. If it sounds like a robot wrote it, rewrite it.

FABRICATION = INSTANT REJECTION:
The candidate's real tools are ONLY: {skills_str}.
Do NOT mention ANY tool not in this list. If the job asks for tools not listed, talk about the work you did, not the tools.
- Keep RESUME facts and TARGET JOB facts separate. Never copy a target feature, mode, domain, metric, or outcome into the candidate's past work unless the RESUME explicitly says the candidate already did it.
- A comparison such as "the same pattern" must not imply that the candidate's project had the employer's exact modes, domain, or outcomes.
- If the confirmed application facts explicitly match the target internship intake, state the matching availability once, without broadening any work-authorization condition.
